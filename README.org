You can use my configuration by two steps:

1. git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/llNoahll/.spacemacs.d ~/.spacemacs.d

2. git clone -b develop https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d    (recommend)

   or git clone -b master https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d

And you can use spacemacs-theme and helm layers in ~/.spacemacs.d/packages/ instand of initial layers.

Happy Hacking!  <(~︶~)>
